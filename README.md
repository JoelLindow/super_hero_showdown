# Super Hero Showdown

### The Purpose of these exercises
Super Hero Showdown is a set of exercises designed to help new Ruby programmers learn how to use Ruby through the practice of *test driven development*. User will clone down this folder and use exercises in the following order of difficulty:
* captain_underpants_test.rb  <--- Super basic class build! Do it in your undies!
* power_puff_girl_test.rb     <--- Let the cuteness launch your learning!
* power_ranger_test.rb        <--- It's morphin time! Zordon is calling!
* freakazoid.rb               <--- It's time to "Freak Out"!
* MORE EXERCISES COMING SOON

#### You will gain the super powers that allow you to:
* Write Ruby Classes that are worthy of the Bat-Computer!
* Fighting the evils of poorly written code through Test Driven Development!
* Debug glitchy code using a single error message!
* Add awesome gadgets to your "coding utility belt" that you can use throughout your future as a developer.
* Possibly gain membership to the "Justice-Nerd-League".

### How to use the exercises
First make sure to install the Minitest gem (`gem install minitest`). If you're having gem installation issues, follow the error messages and they will guide you to the correct gem installation you may require. These tests only require basic `Minitest` and `Pride`.
The user SHOULD NOT edit the test files. Only "un-skip" the tests one at a time as they can achieving writing code that makes the tests pass.
You will need to install the
Each challenge will begin at the same place, with an error message looking for the user to create the file they will be coding in. For example, `power_puff_girls_test.rb` will be looking for the user to be coding in a required file called `power_puff_girl` within the same folder. You would create this folder from inside the `super_hero_showdown` folder by typing `touch power_puff_girls.rb` and then beginning to run the test file repeatedly as you alter code, until you pass the tests one by one. It's up the you, the user, to `touch` that new `.rb` file and you will get an error saying that the test file can not find the proper file required until you create it.
ONCE AGAIN, DO NOT edit the tests. They have been checked multiple times are written correctly to drive you toward writing the intended code in your own associated `.rb` file.

### Have fun!
These exercises are intended to be fun! That's why I went with a Super Hero theme. You too, soon enough, will be a coding Super Hero.
